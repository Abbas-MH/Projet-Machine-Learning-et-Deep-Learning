## 🧩 Project 1 – Customer Segmentation (Wholesale Customers)

🔗 **Data Link:**  
[UCI – Wholesale Customers Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/292/wholesale+customers)

### 🎯 Objective

This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing habits (spending on various products: milk, fresh products, etc.) using dimensionality reduction and clustering methods such as Principal Component Analysis and K-means.

### 🧩 Usefulness

- Better understand typical customer profiles (restaurants, grocers, etc.).
- Target commercial actions (personalized offers, promotions).
- Optimize marketing campaigns according to detected consumer groups.

## 🏘️ Project 2 – Real Estate Price Prediction

🔗 **Data Link:**  
[Challenge ENS - Price Prediction](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/68/)  
📄 **Variable Description (if the link is unavailable):** See below 👇

### 🎯 Objective

This project aims to predict the price of a property based on its characteristics (property type, surface area, number of rooms, energy performance, location, etc.) using supervised models (XGBoost, Linear Regression...).

### 🧩 Usefulness

- Estimate a consistent price for buyers or real estate agencies.
- Detect potentially under- or over-valued properties.
- Provide a decision support tool in the real estate sector.
